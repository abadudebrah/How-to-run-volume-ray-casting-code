# How-to-run-volume-ray-casting-code
This repository describes how to run a volume ray casting code that is already available on GitHub

I completed this assessment using the https://github.com/RolandR/VolumeRayCasting.git repository(A project aimed at developing a powerful real-time volume rendering engine for the browser) 

To successfully run the code, I used the following Methods:

Method 1 (Simplest method)
1. Open the github repository containing the volume ray casting code. In my case this repository: https://github.com/RolandR/VolumeRayCasting
2. Click on the address bar of the window.
3. Edit the URL by ADDING "box" to "github" in the URL. In my case, the new URL becomes https://githubbox.com/RolandR/VolumeRayCasting
4. Click "enter" on the keyboard
5. The resulting window is a CodeSandbox window with the code and displayed output. 

Method 2
Using Visual Studio 2022
1. Install Gitbash on your local machine 
2. Open Visual Studio. In my case, Visual Studio 2022. 
3. On the Get started pane click "clone a repository"
4. Copy the volume ray casting github repository URL you wish to clone. In my case this repository: https://github.com/RolandR/VolumeRayCasting.git
5. Paste the copied URL in the repository location field. Specify a path were the project should be saved to in the path field. 
6. Click on "clone"
7. Install all dependencies and extentions to make program executable without errors. In my case, I installed the "open in browser" extention. 
8. Open the index.html file from the solution explorer pane
9. In the opened index.html file, right click an empty space and click "Open In Default Browser"
10. This opens a window displaying the volume ray casting image
